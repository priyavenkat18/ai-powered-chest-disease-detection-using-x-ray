This project introduces an innovative AI-driven system for automated detection and classification of chest diseases in X-ray images. Using a CNN architecture, it accelerates diagnosis, cutting time and costs. It accurately categorizes pneumonia and COVID-19 cases, promising significant clinical benefits.
I have used data from https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset and https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia.

0 - Covid-19

1 - Normal X-ray

2 - Viral Pneumonia X-ray

3 - Bacterial Pneumonia X-ray
